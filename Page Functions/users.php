	            <h1 class="main-answer overview"><strong class="overview-5q">Overview:</strong> <br><br>- The total figure before the rebate is applied is £350 million BUT that is not the amount that is sent.<br><br>- In 2015 the UK government paid&nbsp;£13 billion&nbsp;to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was&nbsp;£4.5 billion. So the UK’s ‘net contribution’ was estimated at about&nbsp;£8.5 billion.<br><br>- “There is no definitive study of the economic impact of the UK’s EU membership or the costs and benefits of withdrawal”, as the&nbsp;House of Commons Library&nbsp;says.</h1>

	            <h1 class="main-answer context"><strong class="context-5q">Context:</strong> <br><br>- The £275 million figure which is often thrown around is enough, if given directly to the NHS which would be incredibly hard to do, to last it for 18 hours based on current expenditure.<br><br>- The UK government gets some of the membership money back,&nbsp;mainly through&nbsp;payments&nbsp;to farmers and for more economically deprived areas of the country such as Wales and Cornwall as well as R&amp;D grants for universities and business.</h1>

	            <h1 class="answer dark">1. Purely in terms of membership finance the EU is a 'loss' for the UK as it gives more then it receives.<br><br>2. &nbsp;The amount each country should contribute is determined largely by total population size, so with the UK the third most populated in the EU it pays the third highest amount behind Germany and France.</h1>

	            <h1 class="answer dark">3. The membership fee fluctuates over time but has increased in recent years due to inflation and an enlarging of the EU budget to cover increased expenditure on the environment, rural regions and science and research.<br><br>4. Certain countries which are on the European continent and trade with the EU but aren't in it are also subject to membership fees. The UK would most likely have to continue to pay fees to retain access to the single market.</h1>
